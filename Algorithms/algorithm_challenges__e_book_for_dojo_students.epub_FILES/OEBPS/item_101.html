That said, a function that always does exactly the same thing will be useful only in specific situations. It would be better if functions were more flexible and could be customized in some way. Fortunately, you can pass values into functions, so that the functions can behave differently depending on those values. The caller simply inserts these values (called</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span style="font-style:italic">arguments</span><span>) between the parentheses, when it executes the function. When the function is executed, those values are copied in and are available like any other variable. Specifically, inside the function, these copied-in values are referred to as</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span style="font-style:italic">parameters</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>For example, let</span><span>’</span><span>s say that we have pulled our friendly greeting code above into a separate function, named</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">greetSomeone</span><span>. This function could include a parameter that is used by the code inside to customize the greeting, just as we did in our standalone code above. Depending on the argument that the caller sends in, our function would have different outcomes. Tying together the ideas of function</span><span>s, parameters, conditionals</span><span> </span><span>and printing, </span><span>this code could look like this:</span></p><p style="font-size:0.73em; line-height:115%"><span style="font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p class="Code"><span>function</span><span> greetSomeone</span><span>(person)</span></p><p class="Code"><span>{</span></p><p class="Code" style="margin-left:36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span>if (person == "Martin"</span><span>) {</span></p><p class="Code" style="margin-left:36pt"><span>console.log("</span><span>Yo dawg, howz it goin</span><span>?"</span><span>);</span></p><p class="Code" style="margin-left:36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span>}</span></p><p class="Code" style="margin-left:36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span>else </span></p><p class="Code" style="margin-left:36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span>{</span></p><p class="Code" style="margin-left:36pt"><span>console.log("Greetings Earthling!"</span><span>);</span></p><p class="Code" style="margin-left:36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span>}</span></p><p class="Code"><span>}</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>You might notice in the code above that there are curly braces that are not alone on their own lines, as they were in the previous code examples. The JavaScript language does not care whether you give these their own line or include them at the end of the previous line, as long as they are present. Really, braces are a way to indicate to the system some number of lines of code that it should treat as a single group. Without these, </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">IF..ELSE</span><span> and </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">WHILE</span><span> and </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">FOR</span><span> statements will only operate on a single line of code. Even if your loop </span><span style="font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">is</span><span> only a single line of code (and hence would work without braces), it is </span><span>always</span><span> safer to include these, </span><span>in case you add more code</span><span> to your loop later</span><span> – and to reinforce good habits</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>So, is it better to include these on their own lines, or to append them to the ends of the previous lines? This is really a matter of choice:</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span style="font-style:italic">as long as you include them</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>(and you always should), JavaScript doesn't care about a few extra new-line characters or extra spaces. Over time you will develop your own</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">coding style</span><span>, writing source code in the way that is most understandable to you. Keep in mind though that when you join a software team, you will likely need to adopt the team's coding style (if they have one). If they don't, then even in that case you should generally match the style of existing code in the source files where you are working. </span><span>So,</span><span> as you develop your personal style, it is best to stay flexible.</span></p><p class="Normal1"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p class="PageHeader"><span>Chapter 0 –</span><span> </span><span>Foundation Concepts</span></p><p class="Normal1" style="border-top-color:#000000; border-top-style:solid; border-top-width:0.5pt; padding-top:1pt"><span>&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
