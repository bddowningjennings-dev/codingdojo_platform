Recursion occurs when a </span><span style="font-style:italic">function calls itself</span><span>. Dynamic programming is </span><span>more general: </span><span>breaking large problems into smaller, more solvable ones. </span></p><p class="Normal1"><span style="font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p class="Normal1"><span>Let</span><span>’</span><span>s consider an example: </span><span>“</span><span>I</span><span>’</span><span>m thinking of an integer between 1 and 120. Guess it.</span><span>” If you were to guess ‘61’</span><span>, and I said </span><span>“</span><span>nope, that</span><span>’</span><span>s too high,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">then</span><span> </span><span>how would you respond? </span><span>You would treat this</span><span> </span><span>exactly as if we had just started </span><span>and I had said </span><span>“</span><span>I</span><span>’</span><span>m thinkin</span><span>g of an integer between 1 and 60</span><span>.</span><span>”</span><span> In doing this, you reframed the problem as a less complex one, a technique called </span><span style="font-style:italic">dynamic programming</span><span>. </span></p><p class="Normal1"><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p class="Normal1"><span>Let us</span><span> continue: if next you guessed ‘30’</span><span>, and I said </span><span>“</span><span>nope, too low,</span><span>”</span><span> then you could again reframe the problem as </span><span>“</span><span>I</span><span>’</span><span>m th</span><span>inking of a number from 31 to 60</span><span>.</span><span>” Let’s say you then guessed ‘42’</span><span>, to which I said </span><span>“</span><span>Y</span><span>es, you guessed it</span><span>! How did you know</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">that</span><span> was the answer</span><span>?!</span><span>”</span><span> With this </span><span>‘</span><span>divide- and-conquer</span><span>’</span><span> approach, you could</span><span> guess the correct number in a 1-</span><span>120</span><span> range</span><span>, in just 6 guesses on average.</span></p><p class="Normal1"><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p class="Normal1"><span>Why is </span><span>dynamic programming</span><span> useful? This is used when a function can make progress toward solving a problem, but is not able to solve the entire problem immediately. In </span><span>these cases</span><span>, if we always make at least a little </span><span style="font-style:italic">forward progress</span><span>, </span><span>continually revisiting the problem to try again</span><span>, </span><span>then ultimately </span><span>we will complete t</span><span>he task (this is a great metaphor for the power of focus and persistence in daily life as well!).</span><span> Dynamic programming is an effective way to decompose a problem so that it </span><span>takes</span><span> advantage of multiple machines. For our purposes, however, we will use it to better understand </span><span style="font-style:italic">recursion</span><span>. </span></p></div></body></html>
