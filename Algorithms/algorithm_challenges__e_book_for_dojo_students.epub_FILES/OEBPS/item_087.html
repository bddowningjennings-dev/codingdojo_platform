Below is a summary of the ideas we covered. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>Computers can do amazing things but they need to be told what to do. We tell them what to do by running software. </span><span>S</span><span>oftware is generally built from </span><span style="font-style:italic">source code</span><span>, which is readable by humans, and is </span><span>a sequence of </span><span>basic </span><span>steps that a computer will follow exactly. </span><span>There are many different software languages (such as JavaScript), with different ways of expressing these basic steps, however most of the main concepts are universal. </span><span>Our job is to break down problems into these steps</span><span>, and then the computer will </span><span style="font-style:italic">run</span><span> that code</span><span> when told</span><span>. </span><span>Generally, when source code is run, it executes from the first line linearly to the last line. However, we can change this flow by adding “fork-in-the-road” (conditional) or “do-that-part-a-few-times” (loop) structure to our source code. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>A variable is a labeled, local space that can contain a value. We refer to a variable by its label if we want to read or change that value. Values can be a few different types, such as </span><span style="font-style:italic">numbers</span><span> or </span><span style="font-style:italic">strings</span><span> or </span><span style="font-style:italic">booleans</span><span>. A string is a sequence of characters, and a boolean is simply a true/false value. JavaScript</span><span> (also known as JS) automatically changes values from one type to another as needed. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>A single-equals (=) is used to set values in variables</span><span>, and can be combined with normal mathematical operators (</span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">+</span><span> </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">-</span><span> </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">*</span><span> </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">/</span><span>). T</span><span>he </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">==</span><span> operator compares two values, allowing JS to convert data types if needed; the </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">===</span><span> operator does </span><span style="font-style:italic">not</span><span> allow the types to be converted. We print to the </span><span>developer console using the </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">console.log</span><span> function, which accepts a string (or converts inputs to a string). </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>We can examine the values of variables, and divert the flow of source code execution depending on those values, using the </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">IF</span><span> statement. This can be combined with an </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">ELSE</span><span>, to cover the other side of a conditional</span><span> as well; </span><span>these </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">IF…ELSE</span><span> statements can be nested. </span><span>One can create c</span><span>ompound comparisons using logical operators that represent </span><span style="font-style:italic">and</span><span>, </span><span style="font-style:italic">or</span><span> and </span><span style="font-style:italic">not</span><span> (</span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">&amp;&amp;</span><span>, </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">||</span><span>, </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">!</span><span>). </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>To execute a specific piece of source code multiple times, there are two different types of </span><span style="font-style:italic">loops</span><span> available. A </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">FOR</span><span> loop is particularly useful when you know exactly how many times you need </span><span>to loop; in other cases, a </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">WHILE</span><span> loop is simple and flexible. With both kinds of loops, you can use </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">BREAK</span><span> and </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">CONTINUE</span><span> statements to change the flow of code (to exit the loop or skip a certain iteration). </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>We can extract a piece of source code into a </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">FUNCTION</span><span> so that it can easily be called repeatedly.</span><span> </span><span>Functions (like variables) have labels, and to call a function, we list the function name with </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">()</span><span> following it. A function can require one or more values from outside, and we pass those values in by using parameters, which are </span><span>included between the parentheses when calling the function, and similarly specified between the parentheses when defining the function. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>The </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">{</span><span> and </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">}</span><span> characters are used to group code. How you choose to space (or compact) your source code will determine your personal </span><span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">coding style</span><span>. </span></p><p><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p></div></body></html>
