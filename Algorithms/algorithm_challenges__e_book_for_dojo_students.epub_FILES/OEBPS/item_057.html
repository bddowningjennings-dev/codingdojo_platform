It would be very wasteful to simply copy-and-paste that code over and over. Plus, if you ever needed to change the code, you would need to change all those lines one by one. What a mess! Instead, you can indicate that a section of code should be executed some number of times. Consider the following: </span><span>“</span><span>Do the next thing I tell you </span><span style="font-style:italic">four</span><span> times: hop on one foot.</span><span>”</span><span> That would be much better than </span><span>“</span><span>Hop on one foot. Hop on one foot. Hop on one foot. Hop on one foot.</span><span>”</span><span> (even though it is just as silly) Programming languages have the concept of a</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-style:italic">LOOP</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>that is essentially a section of code that will be executed a certain number of times.
