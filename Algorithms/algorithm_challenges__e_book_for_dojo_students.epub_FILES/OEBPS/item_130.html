That is a fine starting point, and good when drawing them on whiteboards, but graphs are almost never actually represented in source code that way. Why not? </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>The problem with graphs, compared to linked lists or binary trees, is that they are </span><span style="font-style:italic">unpredictable</span><span>. Graph vertices can point wherever they want. Vertices can have any number of outbound connections, including zero. They can have any number of inbound connections, including 0. They can form cycles, and cycles-within-cycles. A vertex could even point to itself! For this reason, a graph doesn’t have a clearly-designated </span><span style="font-style:italic">head</span><span> node, as lists and trees do. Also, it isn’t just </span><span style="font-style:italic">nodes</span><span> (vertices) </span><span>that have values, as we are used to. </span><span>The </span><span style="font-style:italic">connections between</span><span style="font-style:italic"> them</span><span> have values too – those “arrows” between nodes have </span><span style="font-style:italic">thicknesses</span><span> that can vary. Some graphs have </span><span style="font-style:italic">bidirectional</span><span> connections that we wouldn’t think of as arrows or pointers. Further, graphs need not be entirely connected: there can be entire sections wholly disconnected from the rest, or loner vertices with no inbound or outbound edges at all. Compared to graphs, even doubly linked lists and unbalanced binary trees are well-behaved and (gasp!) </span><span style="font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">boring</span><span>. So, what </span><span style="font-style:italic">is</span><span> the right way to reduce a graph into a data structure in source code? </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>Graphs are most commonly represented in three different ways. These include </span><span style="font-style:italic">edge list</span><span>, </span><span style="font-style:italic">adjacency map</span><span> and </span><span style="font-style:italic">adjacency list</span><span> concepts. We will build simple versions of each, later this chapter. Despite their differences, each graph data structure does two things: </span><span style="font-style:italic">manage vertices</span><span>, and </span><span style="font-style:italic">manage</span><span style="font-style:italic"> edges</span><span>. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span>You can think of vertices in the same way that you have thought of nodes in a linked list: each is located in a particular place in the structure and has a value that can be set to … well … anything. As mentioned before, we can’t just store the “head node”, because a graph’s vertices may not be interconnected. We need to maintain a list of them. With this in mind, in addition to the graph constructor function, we would expect a graph to have a </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">this.vertList</span><span> that contains our vertices, as well as the following functions to manage vertices: </span></p></div><div style="clear:both; mso-break-type:section-break; page-break-before:auto"><p style="line-height:115%"><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">addVertex(val) // returns vertId</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">removeVertex(vertId)</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><br style="mso-column-break-before:always; clear:both" /><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif"> </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">getVertexValue(vertId)</span><span> </span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">setVertexValue(vertId, val)</span></p></div><div style="clear:both; mso-break-type:section-break; page-break-before:auto"><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, we’d expect to see the following functions, to manage edges: </span></p></div><div style="clear:both; mso-break-type:section-break; page-break-before:auto"><p style="line-height:115%"><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">addEdge(vertId1, vertId2, val)</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">removeEdge(vertId1, vertId2)</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><br style="mso-column-break-before:always; clear:both" /><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif"> </span><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">getEdgeValue(vertId1, vertId2)</span></p><p style="line-height:115%"><span class="CodeSnippet" style="font-family:Times, serif">setEdgeValue(vertId1, vertId2, val)</span></p></div><div style="clear:both; mso-break-type:section-break; page-break-before:auto"><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>Graph representations may not have a dedicated list of edges – this is one place where our graph data structures differ in their approaches. Also, notice that edges can attach a value – more on that later. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>First, though, let’s dive into one way to represent graphs.</span></p><p><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p class="PageHeader"><span>Chapter 17</span><span> – Graphs</span></p><p class="Normal1" style="border-top-color:#000000; border-top-style:solid; border-top-width:0.5pt; padding-top:1pt"><span>&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
